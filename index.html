        <h2 align="left"><u><i>HISTORY OF JHANSI</i></u></h2>
        <p align="left"><i>Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828 in the town of Varanasi. She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu. Her father was Moropant Tambe and her mother was Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai); they hailed from modern-day Maharashtra. At four years old her mother passed away. Her father was the Commander of War under Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithorr District. She was educated at home, able to read and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included shooting, horsemanship, and fencing which was in contrast to the cultural expectations for women in Indian society at the time.</i></p>

But he died after four months.Gangadhar Rao died in 1853. Before he died, he had adopted his cousin's son Anand Rao, who was renamed, Damodar Rao.</i></p>
